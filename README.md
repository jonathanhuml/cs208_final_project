# cs208_final_project
Code+paper for Differential Privacy class


This repository includes the code and paper of the final project for CS208 at Harvard Spring 2022. 

In the code, we explore intermediate models of differential privacy in the context of uniformity testing.

The paper surveys various results on pan-private and shuffle-private models, comparing and contrasting with the central and local models of DP.
